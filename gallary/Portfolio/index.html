                 When I was young my favorite movie was The Matrix. The special effects and action filled plot was enough to keep my curious mind entertained.
                 As I've grown older, the movie has still been one of my all time favorites. In my opinion the message is still sound. 
                 We as programmers must take responsibility for what we produce, and ensure that we don't create something that may seem helpful now, but could
                 be bad for society in the future.

                <h1>What I've Learned So Far</h1>
             <p> I am in my first semester at the College of Western Idaho pursuing an Associates of Applied Science degree in software development. 
                From there I hope to attend Boise State University and pursue a Bachelor's of Applied Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering. 
                I am familiar with C# and I am currently learning HTML and CSS. I am also trying to teach myself Python with the help of <i>Learn Python the Hard Way 
                by Zed Shaw</i> and <i>Python Cookbook 3rd edition by David Beazley and Brian Jones</i> .
